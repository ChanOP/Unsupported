Unsupported miscellaneous scripts
======
You will find miscellaneous other extensions that do not exactly fit the above categories. Readme files or script comments will describe their use.


Note
-----
Please remember that these scripts are provided for your use and education but are not supported by the Zenphoto team. This is true even if a team member originally created them. 

They may not work correctly with current Zenphoto versions as they are not actively maintained. Although they may occasionally be updated for the current Zenphoto release. 

We of course welcome any contribution or even taking over a certain theme: http://www.zenphoto.org/news/general-contributor-guidelines#providing-themes-and-plugins
